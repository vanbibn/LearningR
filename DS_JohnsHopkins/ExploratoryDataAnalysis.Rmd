## Graphics Devices

Two ways to create a plot:
1. Call a plotting function, and the plot appears on the screen
    + Annotate the plot if necessary
2. For sending a plot to a file device (plot will not actually appear on screen):
    A. Explicitly launch graphics device
    B. Call a plotting function to make a plot (copy paste from script)
    C. Annotate if necessary
    D. **Important!** Explicitly *close* graphics device with `dev.off()` 

```{r}
library(datasets)
with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting)) ## make plot appear on the screen
title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser data")  ## Annotate with a title
```
